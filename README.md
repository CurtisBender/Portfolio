## Projects
### Dependence of NBA Free Throws
[Project](https://github.com/CurtisBender/Dependence-of-NBA-Free-Throws)

Determined how the result of the first free throw affects the probability of making the second free throw using the **Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and pymer4** libraries in **Python**. 

Cleaned and analyzed a dataset containing information for over **600 thousand** NBA free throws. 

Analysis involved individual player analysis and a general player analysis.

The individual player analysis entailed calculating **p-values** for individual players with the null hypothesis that consecutive free throws are independent events and applying a **multiple testing correction**.

The general player analysis used **mixed effects logistic regression** to model the probability of a player making the second free throw given the result of the first, while accounting for differences in overall free throw abilities amongst different players.
